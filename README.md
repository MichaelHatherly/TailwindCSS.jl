# TailwindCSS.jl

A wrapper package for the [TailwindCSS CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
for ease of use from within Julia-based web projects.

This package exports the `tailwindcss()` function which provides the path to
the bundled Tailwind CSS CLI tool, which can be used to compile CSS output
outside of the NodeJS ecosystem. See the docs for the tool for all available
usage.
